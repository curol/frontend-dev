# PostCSS

> “PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JS plugins. These plugins can support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more."

In a nutshell, PostCSS takes CSS and turns it into a form of data that JavaScript can manipulate. JavaScript-based plugins for PostCSS then perform said code manipulations. PostCSS itself doesn’t change your CSS, it just paves the way for plugins to perform whatever transformations they’ve been designed to make.

There are essentially no limitations on the kind of manipulation PostCSS plugins can apply to CSS. If you can think of it, you can probably write a PostCSS plugin to make it happen.

PostCSS plugins can behave like preprocessors; they can optimize and autoprefix code, they can add future syntax, they can perform linting, they can process variables and logic, they can provide complete grid systems, they can offer coding shortcuts... the list is long and varied.
