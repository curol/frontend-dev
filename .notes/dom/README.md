The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document.
The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).
The DOM is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an HTML or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.
Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.
DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document.[2] Nodes can have event handlers attached to them.
Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

The backbone of an HTML document is tags.
According to the Document Object Model (DOM), every HTML tag is an object.
Nested tags are “children” of the enclosing one.
The text inside a tag is an object as well.
All these objects are accessible using JavaScript, and we can use them to modify the page.
For example, document.body is the object representing the <body> tag.
